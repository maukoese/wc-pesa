# wc-pesa
A unified WooCommerce payments extension for Kenya

## About Pesa for WooCommerce

### The Plugin
<p>This plugin builds on the work of <a href="https://github.com/moshthepitt/woocommerce-lipa-na-mpesa">Kelvin Jayanoris</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ModoPesa/wc-mpesa">myself</a> and others to provide a unified solution for receiving Mobile payments in Kenya, using the top telcos. Only Safaricom MPesa, Airtel Money and Equitel Money are supported for now.</p>

### Development
<p>I hope to develop this further into a full-fledged free, simple, direct and secure ecommerce payments system. You can help by contributing here:</p>

<li><a href="https://github.com/ModoPesa/wc-equitel">Equitel For WooCommerce(IPN)</a></li>

## 3Pro Version
<p>While this plugin is free - because some of us are FOSS apostles - there will be a pro version. That is not to say this version doesn't have the requisite features - it does, really. The Pro version is for those who want more - analytics, 24/7 support, maintenance, the whole enchilada.</p>
